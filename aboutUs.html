    Please take a moment to look around. It may feel as if you’ve taken a giant step back in time. Maybe you’ve spotted the vintage jukebox, the coca-cola collectibles or the soda fountain. You might not be aware that Crown Candy Kitchen is one of St Louis’ oldest and most popular attractions. 

Crown Candy Kitchen was opened in 1913 by Harry Karandzieff and his best friend Pete Jugaloff. They brought their confectionary skills from Greece, along with a dream of providing a friendly family environment to enjoy their delicious creations. During the early 50’s Harry’s son George took the business over and built the business into what it is today. Now George’s three sons – Andy, Tommy and Mike run the business with a little help from the 4th generation. 

Did you know that Crown Candy Kitchen makes their own chocolate candy? Whether it’s for a weekly candy run, to fill Christmas stockings, for your sweetheart on Valentine’s Day or for Easter baskets – Crown Candy Kitchen has been satisfying the “sweet tooth” of St Louisans for many generations. 

Besides the soda fountain and candy, Crown Candy Kitchen serves great food for lunch and dinner. Whether you’re in the mood for a thick stacked sandwich, chili, a giant gourmet frank, a salad or a bowl of soup – Crown Candy Kitchen’s staff is ready to prepare a fresh hearty meal to satisfy your appetite. 

Don’t forget to leave room for dessert. Nobody leaves Crown Candy Kitchen without trying one of our world-renowned desserts (it’s family policy). When was the last time that you had a Butterscotch Malted, Chocolate Phosphate or a Deluxe Sundae? 

Before leaving, make sure to grab something for a friend, loved one or office mate. All candy, desserts and souvenirs can be packaged for takeout. You’ll definitely be someone’s hero! Crown Candy Kitchen’s staff hope you’ve enjoyed your visit and look forward to seeing you again in the near future.  </p>
